This blog is the beginning of a thread, a documentary. It documents a timeline that touches upon many lives.  A timeline that has now touched you. Savor each moment, for it never returns the same. Relish the experience. Multiply it. Tell as many as you can about the coming undoing. Tell them about what the next decade holds for humans - those who haven't yet been **dhumanized**.

It is still Day 0 (thanks Jeff...). You might want to try the About section.
